# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.15] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Runtime port defaults**: local development now prefers app port `3002` and
  bridge port `3003`, with launcher/runtime config keeping the browser bridge
  URL aligned.
- **Remote-control helper**: added a local WebSocket remote-control CLI for
  status, session telemetry, and Codex-origin command intents.
- **Expanded release gates**: added prompt policy, remote-control, remote UI,
  remote CLI, live bridge, hall, dialogue, and UX harness coverage to the
  bundled test suite.

### Changed
- **Guild Ledger active output**: the newest active output line now owns the
  only living glow immediately when it starts typing. The shimmer inherits each
  line's semantic color, loops continuously, and speeds up under backlog
  pressure so large streams do not stall behind presentation effects.
- **Multi-agent audit policy**: full audits now treat `seo-sxo` as part of the
  always-on specialist set and instruct delegated workers to preserve the
  selected strength profile.
- **Development docs**: README, installation, troubleshooting, and command docs
  now use the `3002`/`3003` local port convention and describe env-first,
  optional-MCP audit behavior.

### Fixed
- **Queue and steering clarity**: generic queue bookkeeping no longer pollutes
  the permanent Guild Ledger transcript, while queued prompts remain visible in
  the queue panel until submitted, steered, edited, or removed.
- **Reduced motion behavior**: active output shimmer and other decorative ledger
  motion now shut down cleanly when the browser reports reduced-motion
  preference.
- **Dungeon Hall return state**: returning to or resuming the hall preserves the
  user's scroll position and avoids hidden header/footer hit-target overlap.

## [2.2.14] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Codex app-server schema**: text input payloads now match the installed
  Codex app-server `text_elements` contract.
- **Stress harness ports**: the stress harness probes usable ports before
  launching repeated bridge and Vite cycles.

### Quality
- Validated with `npm run test:all`, `npm run build`, and a fresh 10-iteration
  stress loop.

## [2.2.13] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Dialogue harness hardening**: expanded queue, steer, stop, edit, reorder,
  and stale-bridge handling coverage.
- **Title hit targets**: tightened title-screen interaction targets used during
  dialogue regression tests.

### Quality
- Validated with `npm run test:all`, `SEO_DUNGEON_STRESS_ITERATIONS=5 npm run
  test:stress`, and `npm run build`.

## [2.2.12] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Active-turn steering**: queued prompts are injected into the running Codex
  app-server turn instead of being treated as a stop or cancel path.
- **Stream rendering**: tiny Codex app-server deltas are coalesced before
  rendering, preventing one-word-per-line Guild Ledger output.
- **Bridge cleanup scope**: process cleanup is scoped to the owning browser
  connection so probes, refreshes, or secondary clients cannot cancel another
  active run.

### Quality
- Added isolated live bridge self-tests with a fake Codex app-server.
- Added browser UX harness coverage for title launch, YOLO arming, battle
  routing, queue, steer, stop-and-hold, held prompt submission, and stream
  rendering.

## [2.2.11] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Bridge health and capabilities**: added bridge `/health` and
  `/capabilities` readbacks so the local bridge can prove its version and
  steering support.
- **Stale bridge detection**: frontend capability probing now explains when an
  outdated bridge cannot support live steering.

### Fixed
- **Steering allowlist**: the bridge allowlist includes `steer` and
  `capabilities`, with CLI regression coverage.

## [2.2.10] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Input mechanics**: hardened idle send, busy queueing, selected steering,
  held sends, queue clearing, and Stop behavior.
- **Queue integrity**: failed steering keeps the prompt in its original queue
  position, and queued prompts stay distinct until actually submitted or
  steered.
- **Escape handling**: a single Escape press can no longer accidentally stop an
  active turn.

### Quality
- Added regression coverage for Tab queueing, send-button queueing, edit,
  remove, reorder, steer failure, held queues, reconnect draining, and queue
  clearing.

## [2.2.9] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- **Composer controls**: added a Codex-app-inspired composer button that sends
  while idle and queues while an agent turn is active.
- **Queue panel visibility**: the queue stack stays hidden when there are no
  queued prompts instead of showing an empty running panel.
- **Stop placement**: Stop remains a separate interrupt control in the composer
  row.

### Quality
- Tightened browser regression coverage for composer controls and queued prompt
  state labels.

## [2.2.8] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **App-server steering**: Codex mode routes through app-server by default so
  steering uses turn/steer instead of cancelling active work.

### Fixed
- **Stop versus steer**: Stop remains a separate interrupt/cancel behavior and
  is not used for steering.
- **Queued prompt controls**: hardened queued prompt editing, selection,
  removal, held queues, and auto-drain edge cases.
- **Startup steering races**: added browser dialogue state coverage for startup
  and steering timing.

## [2.2.7] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Guild Ledger prompt queue**: ledger input now supports queued prompts, a
  visible queue panel, queue clearing, and clicking queued rows to run them or
  promote them to the next turn while an agent is busy.
- **Steer-next behavior**: sending a prompt while an audit, fix, commit, or
  battle turn is active now queues that prompt at the front instead of starting
  a competing CLI process.

### Changed
- **Session-only YOLO arming**: YOLO Mode now starts disarmed on every fresh app
  load and must be clicked each time before entering the dungeon; stale browser
  storage and URL parameters no longer arm it automatically.

### Fixed
- **Agent settle tracking**: fix, commit, audit, narration, cancellation, and
  battle turn completion now emit a shared settle signal so queued prompts wait
  until the current turn is actually safe to advance.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Mandatory YOLO Mode arming**: the title screen now requires users to arm
  YOLO Mode before entering the dungeon, with a compact red launch control and
  setup/launch divider.
- **Codex dangerous bypass launch path**: Codex runs now pass
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` when launched through SEO
  Dungeon, avoiding the workspace sandbox/network restrictions that blocked
  GitHub push workflows.

### Fixed
- **Bypass state persistence**: the YOLO Mode choice persists across launches,
  and URL query parameters seed the state once without overriding later clicks.
- **Bridge launch coverage**: CLI launcher tests now assert that unarmed Codex
  launch attempts fail and armed Codex launches include the dangerous bypass
  flag without also requesting `workspace-write`.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Project `.env` integration path**: the dungeon bridge now forwards known
  SEO-related keys from the selected project `.env` and `.env.local` into the
  selected local CLI, including DataForSEO, Firecrawl, Google, GA4, GSC, and
  Railway variables.
- **Direct API helpers**: added lightweight DataForSEO and Firecrawl scripts so
  live SEO data and crawl workflows can run from project credentials without
  requiring MCP setup.

### Changed
- **Env-first audit policy**: audit and chat prompts now instruct Codex, Claude,
  and Gemini to prefer direct API/script access from project credentials, using
  MCP servers only as quiet optional adapters when already available.
- **Integration docs**: DataForSEO, Firecrawl, Google, and extension docs now
  frame MCP as optional instead of required for normal SEO Dungeon audits.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- **Simpler quick-open icons**: replaced the drawn folder glyph and external-link
  arrow with emoji buttons for the website and project folder actions.

### Fixed
- **Project folder recovery**: if the saved project path is missing or invalid,
  the folder button now opens a native folder picker and saves the newly chosen
  folder instead of stopping at an error.
- **Default project folder**: the title screen now defaults to
  `E:\seo-dungeon-website` for the SEO Dungeon website source instead of the
  obsolete `D:\seodungeon` path.
- **Domain quick-open reliability**: the website button now uses direct anchor
  navigation instead of popup-window routing, avoiding `about:blank` fallbacks.
- **SEO Dungeon alias support**: typing `SEO Dungeon` in the domain field now
  resolves to `seodungeon.com` for both quick-open and audit launch.
- **Bridge command safety**: Git branch setup now uses argument-based process
  calls instead of shell-interpolated command strings.
- **Bridge origin policy**: WebSocket clients without an Origin header are now
  rejected unless `SEO_DUNGEON_ALLOW_NO_ORIGIN=1` is set for local development.
- **Audit log redaction**: failed-audit evidence logs now mask common
  secret-looking tokens before writing raw agent output.
- **Bridge QC coverage**: CLI launcher tests now cover origin validation and
  failed-audit redaction behavior.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Resizable Guild Ledger**: the right-hand ledger can now be dragged wider or
  narrower while the dungeon view keeps its aspect-ratio aware Phaser layout.
- **Ledger hide/show control**: added a top-left ledger button to collapse the
  sidebar and a small reopen tab when users want the dungeon view to take the
  full window.
- **Responsive title stage**: the splash screen now scales with the available
  dungeon pane when users resize or hide the Guild Ledger.
- **Unified character sprite fitting**: the Warrior, Samurai, and Knight
  title-screen sprites now share the same centered viewport and cannot clip when
  the Guild Ledger is widened.
- **Remembered title inputs**: domain, project folder, ledger width, and ledger
  open/closed state persist across reloads and later app launches.
- **Quick-open title actions**: added a domain button that opens the current
  website in a new tab and a project-folder button that reveals the folder
  through the local bridge.
- **Demon Lord prompt composer**: the Guild Ledger prompt now auto-grows for
  long instructions up to half the viewport, then scrolls internally without
  covering or collapsing the ledger feed.
- **Claude/Gemini caution modal**: selecting Claude Code or Gemini CLI now
  opens a full-screen blood-red warning modal that requires explicit consent
  before leaving the Codex default path.

### Fixed
- **Quick-open reliability**: the website button now normalizes bare domains
  to real HTTPS URLs, and the project-folder button launches the native file
  manager visibly before logging the opened path.
- **Character scale at roomy widths**: title-screen characters now grow into
  their cards when the Guild Ledger is narrow or hidden while still avoiding
  clipping when the ledger is maximized.
- **FLOW sync dry-run resilience**: the FLOW reference sync now retries GitHub
  429 rate-limit responses with authenticated headers when `gh` is available.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Bridge log file and watcher**: live bridge output is now mirrored to
  `dungeon/.logs/bridge.log`, and `npm run logs` tails it for development
  visibility while the app is running.

### Fixed
- **Prompt argument preservation**: Windows npm PowerShell shims for Codex and
  Gemini are now resolved to their underlying Node entrypoints before spawning.
  This keeps long audit prompts as a single argument and fixes Codex errors such
  as `unexpected argument 'actionable' found` and Gemini errors such as `Cannot
  use both a positional prompt and the --prompt (-p) flag together`.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- **Public positioning refresh**: README, docs, package metadata, and installer
  copy now frame SEO Dungeon as a local AI SEO audit app with Codex, Claude Code,
  and Gemini CLI runtime options. Codex remains the packaged default without
  making the public repo read like a Codex-only project.
- **Gemini profile defaults**: Gemini Warrior/Samurai/Knight profiles now use
  the Gemini CLI model aliases `pro`, `flash`, and `flash-lite` instead of
  brittle concrete preview model names.

### Fixed
- **Windows CLI launching**: the dungeon bridge now resolves PATH-ordered
  `.ps1`, `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.exe` shims before spawning Codex, Claude, or
  Gemini. This fixes the `ERROR: spawn EPERM` failure seen with Windows
  package-manager and WindowsApps shims.
- **Bridge child cleanup**: failed and timed-out child processes now clear their
  active request slots, preventing one failed spawn from blocking later runs.
- **Launcher test coverage**: added a Node CLI-launcher regression test and
  wired it into the dungeon CI job before the app build.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Public v2.2 SEO engine refresh**: synchronized the bundled SEO engine with
  Daniel Agrici's public `AgriciDaniel/claude-seo` v2.2.0 tag, including the
  25 sub-skills, 18 portable sub-agents, 50 Python scripts, extension mirrors,
  security fixes, and knowledge-currency updates from upstream.
- **Runtime picker**: added a title-screen CLI selector for Codex, Claude, and
  Gemini. Codex remains the default runtime.
- **Dynamic character profiles**: replaced Claude-specific character internals
  with neutral `deep`, `balanced`, and `fast` profiles. Codex maps those to
  `xhigh`, `high`, and `medium`; Claude maps to `opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku`;
  Gemini maps to Pro, Flash, and fast Flash model families.
- **Portable agent prompts**: restored the public `agents/` Markdown prompts
  alongside SEO Dungeon's Codex TOML profiles.

### Changed
- **Packaged default runtime**: documentation, installer output, app metadata,
  and runtime copy now describe SEO Dungeon as Codex-compatible and
  local-runtime compatible rather than Codex-only.
- **Dependency hardening**: updated the dungeon app dependency set to clear
  `npm audit` and added a CI app build/audit job on Node 22.
- **Version triangulation**: bumped plugin, Python metadata, citation metadata,
  installer defaults, and dungeon package metadata to `2.2.0`.

### Fixed
- **Runtime cache isolation**: cached audits now include both runtime and
  profile in their keys so switching between Codex, Claude, and Gemini cannot
  reuse the wrong cached run.
- **Bridge dispatch**: the local bridge now forwards runtime and profile
  explicitly and supports Codex JSON streaming plus text-output Claude/Gemini
  CLI runs.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- **Public v2 engine refresh**: synchronized the bundled SEO engine with the
  public `AgriciDaniel/claude-seo` v2.0.0 release, including hardened URL
  safety, shared rendering support, schema v2 coverage, content-quality gates,
  parasite-risk scanning, and new technical SEO helper scripts.
- **Codex-only packaging preserved**: retained SEO Dungeon's Codex bridge,
  Codex agent profiles, installer path, docs, and tests while excluding
  Claude/Gemini runtime packaging and the Gemini-backed image generation skill.
- **Optional SEO integrations expanded**: bundled public v2 extension skill
  mirrors for Ahrefs, Bing Webmaster, Profound, SE Ranking, and Unlighthouse
  alongside the existing DataForSEO and Firecrawl integrations.

### Fixed
- **Version triangulation**: bumped plugin, Python metadata, citation metadata,
  installer defaults, and dungeon package metadata to `2.0.0`.

## [1.9.9] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **Upstream SEO engine v1.9.9 parity**: synchronized the bundled SEO engine with
  the final public 1.x patch from `AgriciDaniel/claude-seo`, including
  orchestrator list cleanup, skill `metadata.version` alignment, extension mirror
  version alignment, and manifest guardrails.
- **Image lazy-loading detection**: `scripts/parse_html.py` now reports
  `lazy_method` per image and detects native lazy loading, Perfmatters, EWWW Image
  Optimizer, and generic JavaScript lazy-loader patterns. This prevents optimized
  WordPress sites from being incorrectly reported as missing lazy loading.
- **Sub-skill/sub-agent drift checks**: expanded `tests/test_manifest_consistency.py`
  to verify orchestrator sub-skill and sub-agent lists, skill metadata versions,
  installer default release refs, pyproject version parity, and marketplace author
  parity.

### Changed
- **Dependency floors**: bumped Playwright, WeasyPrint, OpenPyXL,
  google-api-python-client, and google-auth-oauthlib floors to match upstream
  v1.9.9 while preserving upper bounds.
- **Codex-only runtime stance**: documentation, installers, manifests, tests, and
  the game bridge now support Codex only. Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Claude API
  harnesses, Gemini API harnesses, and consumer-app wrappers are intentionally
  unsupported.
- **Gemini-backed image generation removed**: removed the Banana/Gemini extension,
  `/seo image-gen` skill, and matching agent profiles so the project no longer
  points users toward high-cost or account-risky runtime paths.
- **Installer default**: remote installs now default to `v1.9.9` instead of the
  floating `main` ref.

## [1.9.8] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Skill-count drift returned via PR #56.** When the `seo-content-brief` skill
  was merged into v1.9.7 it added a 21st core skill, but the manifest
  reconciliation in v1.9.7 had locked the canonical phrasing at "20 core" and
  was not re-run after Phase C. Result: plugin.json, marketplace.json,
  README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md all under-claimed
  by one. Reconciled to "25 sub-skills (21 core + 1 orchestrator + 1 framework
  integration + 2 extension mirrors)".

### Added
- **`tests/test_manifest_consistency.py`**: pytest suite that asserts
  plugin.json + marketplace.json claimed counts match the actual on-disk
  count of `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `agents/seo-*.md`, that plugin.json and
  marketplace.json descriptions agree on the canonical math, that user-visible
  docs (README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) reference the same skill count, and that
  plugin.json `version` and CITATION.cff `version` triangulate. Closes the
  systemic gap that allowed two skill-count drift incidents in v1.9.7.
- **`pytest tests/` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: runs the new manifest
  consistency suite on every push to main and every pull request, gating
  future skill additions behind matching documentation updates.

### Changed
- **`uninstall.sh` and `uninstall.ps1` now use glob enumeration** rather than a
  hardcoded skill list. The previous scripts had been frozen at v1.4.0-era
  state and missed 12 sub-skills and 11 sub-agents added between v1.5 and
  v1.9.8 (`seo-backlinks`, `seo-cluster`, `seo-content-brief`, `seo-dataforseo`,
  `seo-drift`, `seo-ecommerce`, `seo-flow`, `seo-google`, `seo-image-gen`,
  `seo-local`, `seo-maps`, `seo-sxo` and the corresponding agents). Anyone who
  ran the old uninstaller got half a cleanup. Glob enumeration auto-tracks
  future skill additions without requiring uninstaller maintenance. Sandbox
  test confirms the new scripts remove every `seo` and `seo-*` skill plus
  every `seo-*.md` agent while leaving sibling skills (e.g. `blog-writer`,
  `security`) untouched.
- This release rolls forward two commits that landed on main after the v1.9.7
  tag was cut:
  - `8514999`: marketplace metadata polish (added `category: "marketing"`,
    `author.email`, `homepage: https://claude-seo.md`, and a 14-keyword array
    to the marketplace.json plugin entry)
  - `66a7485`: em-dash sweep on user-visible AGENTS.md and CHANGELOG.md
  Both were intentionally scoped at v1.9.7 but landed post-tag. v1.9.8 captures
  them properly.

## [1.9.7] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Skill-count drift across 5 manifests**: `plugin.json` ("20 core sub-skills"),
  `marketplace.json` ("21 core sub-skills"), `CLAUDE.md` line 7 ("21 core sub-skills"),
  `AGENTS.md` line 8 ("20 core sub-skills") + line 84 ("23 skills"), and `README.md`
  line 7 ("21 core sub-skills") all contradicted each other. Reconciled to canonical
  phrasing: "24 sub-skills (20 core + 1 orchestrator + 1 framework integration +
  2 extension mirrors)".
- **Sub-agent count drift**: `CLAUDE.md` claimed "16 core subagents (+ 2 extension
  agents, 18 total)" while `AGENTS.md` claimed "15 core subagents (+ 2 extension
  agents, 17 total)". Reconciled to: "18 sub-agents (15 core + 1 framework integration +
  2 extension mirrors)".
- **`CLAUDE.md` self-contradiction**: line 23 stated `plugin.json (v1.9.0)`; updated
  to current `v1.9.7`.
- **`marketplace.json` description fields**: both `metadata.description` (top-level)
  and `plugins[0].description` now use canonical phrasing.
- **`CITATION.cff` version drift**: was stuck at `1.8.2` (six minor versions behind);
  bumped to match `plugin.json` at `1.9.7` with current release date.

### Added
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`**: weekly Dependabot updates for pip and GitHub Actions
  ecosystems (closes supply-chain hygiene gap).
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: Contributor Covenant 2.1, closing GitHub Community
  Standards gap.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `permissions:` block**: restricts `GITHUB_TOKEN` to
  `contents: read` at workflow root (least-privilege; was previously default scope).

### Changed
- Patch release driven by repository hygiene + marketplace-readiness preparation.
  No skill behavior changes, no breaking changes, no script changes.

### Removed
- **`translations/uk/`**: the Ukrainian localization (originally contributed by
  @edocltd in PR #50, shipped in v1.9.0) has been retired. The translation drifted
  across v1.9.0 to v1.9.7 with no maintenance signal, and a partially translated set
  is worse than no translation at all when readers cannot tell what is current.
  @edocltd's contribution remains credited in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`. If a maintained
  translation is desired in the future, it should land via a contributor who can
  commit to keeping it in sync release over release.

## [1.9.6] - 2026-04-26

### Security
- **VULN-A01 (HIGH):** Removed `Bash` from `seo-flow` agent tool grant, agent no
  longer has shell access, eliminating prompt-injection-to-shell attack surface
- **VULN-A02/A07 (MEDIUM/LOW):** Switched `sync_flow.py` to anonymous-first GitHub API
  requests; PAT only used as 403-triggered fallback, eliminates token-on-redirect leak
- **VULN-A03 (MEDIUM):** Added `Path.resolve()` containment check in `record_write()`,
  blocks path-traversal writes outside the skill reference directory
- **VULN-A04 (MEDIUM):** Introduced `flow-prompts.lock` SHA-256 baseline file; sync now
  diffs against baseline and reports upstream drift before writing
- **VULN-A05 (MEDIUM):** Added explicit "WebFetch is untrusted" security rule to agent
  body, agent warned not to execute or relay fetched content verbatim
- **VULN-A06 (LOW):** `gh` CLI absence now degrades to anonymous API rather than
  hard-exiting, sync works without gh CLI on public repos
- **VULN-A08 (LOW):** All file writes are now atomic (tempfile + shutil.move),
  eliminates partial-write corruption on interrupt
- **VULN-A09 (LOW):** GitHub API responses capped at 5 MB with 15s timeout,
  prevents memory exhaustion from malformed or oversized API payloads
- **VULN-A10 (LOW):** URL allowlist validates every request targets `api.github.com`
  over HTTPS, blocks SSRF if `API_ROOT` constant is modified
- **INFO-A14:** Added CC BY 4.0 attribution header to `references/prompts/README.md`

### Tests
- Added 10 new unit/integration tests covering all above findings
- Test count: 5 → 15

## [1.9.5] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **seo-flow**: FLOW framework integration, Find → Leverage → Optimize → Win. 41 evidence-led AI prompts (CC BY 4.0) bundled as `skills/seo-flow/references/prompts/` (find:5, leverage:1, optimize:21, win:3, local:11). Commands: `/seo flow [find|leverage|optimize|win|local|prompts|sync]`.
- **Context-matching orchestration**: `/seo flow optimize` selects 2-3 most relevant prompts from 21 based on URL industry signals and prior skill output, not a full dump.
- **`scripts/sync_flow.py`**: GitHub API sync script, pulls latest FLOW prompts, framework doc, and bibliography from AgriciDaniel/flow. Supports `--dry-run` and `--ref <sha>` pinning. Outputs JSON summary.
- **`agents/seo-flow.md`**: FLOW subagent, applies stage prompts to target URLs, returns structured evidence-tagged findings.
- **FLOW cross-references**: Integration notes added to seo-geo, seo-local, seo-content, and seo-cluster skills.

### License
- FLOW content bundled under CC BY 4.0. Attribution header on every prompt file (automated by `sync_flow.py`). Claude SEO's MIT license unchanged, applies to skill code only.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **seo-cluster**: SERP-based semantic topic clustering for content architecture (skill + 3 references + interactive cluster-map.html visualization + agent). Contributed by Lutfiya Miller (Pro Hub Challenge Winner).

- **seo-drift**: SEO drift monitoring, baseline, diff, and track changes to on-page SEO with 17 comparison rules across 3 severity levels. SQLite persistence (skill + 1 reference + agent + 4 Python scripts). Contributed by Dan Colta. Security-hardened: all curl usage eliminated, SSRF protection enforced.
- **seo-ecommerce**: E-commerce SEO, Google Shopping intelligence, Amazon marketplace analysis, product schema validation (skill + 1 reference + agent + 2 Python scripts). Contributed by Matej Marjanovic.
- **DataForSEO cost guardrails**: `scripts/dataforseo_costs.py` with threshold-based approval, session budget tracking, daily spend summaries. `references/cost-tiers.md` pricing table. Contributed by Matej Marjanovic.
- **seo-hreflang cultural profiles**: 4 cultural adaptation profiles (DACH, Francophone, Hispanic, Japanese) with locale format tables, content parity audit, and freshness tracking. 3 new reference files. Contributed by Chris Muller.
- **CONTRIBUTORS.md**: Community credits file for Pro Hub Challenge and PR contributors
- **AGENTS.md**: Multi-platform discovery file for Cursor/Antigravity (concept by Matej Marjanovic, rewritten for v1.9.0)
- **Schema templates**: Product (Full E-commerce) and ItemList (hub/pillar pages) added to `schema/templates.json`
- 5 new commands: `/seo cluster`, `/seo sxo`, `/seo drift baseline|compare|history`, `/seo ecommerce`

### Changed

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Ukrainian localization**: first i18n, README, CONTRIBUTING, PRIVACY, SECURITY, INSTALLATION, TROUBLESHOOTING translated (PR #50)
- **Firecrawl extension section** in README with install and example commands
- **Backlink API privacy disclosures** in PRIVACY.md (Moz, Bing Webmaster, Common Crawl, verify crawler)
- 4 missing commands added to README table: `/seo backlinks`, `/seo firecrawl`, `/seo dataforseo`, `/seo image-gen`
- 6 missing scripts added to CI syntax check (backlinks_auth, moz_api, bing_webmaster, commoncrawl_graph, verify_backlinks, validate_backlink_report)
- 6 missing skill directories added to INSTALLATION.md manual uninstall list

### Fixed
- **Install scripts pinned to stale version**: REPO_TAG bumped from v1.7.2 to v1.8.2 in install.sh and install.ps1, new curl-based installs now get the current release
- **Supply chain risk in docs**: removed deprecated `irm | iex` pattern from docs/INSTALLATION.md, replaced with safe `git clone` + `powershell -File` method
- **Version sync**: pyproject.toml (1.7.2→1.8.2), CITATION.cff (1.7.2→1.8.2, date 2026-04-10), all 19 SKILL.md files
- **Python requirement**: pyproject.toml corrected from `>=3.11` to `>=3.10` (matches README and install scripts)
- **README architecture counts**: sub-skills "15+2" → "16+3", agents "10+2" → "11+2"

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Security
- **Install script supply chain fix**: Replaced `irm | iex` Windows PowerShell one-liner with `git clone + powershell -File` as primary install method. Claude Code's own security guardrails flagged the old pattern as a supply chain risk (reported by community member). Added collapsible "review before running" section for Unix curl method.
- **Version pinning**: `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now clone a specific release tag (`v1.3.0`) by default rather than `main`, preventing silent updates. Override with `CLAUDE_SEO_TAG=main`.
- **PowerShell Invoke-External hardening**: Comprehensive `PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference` handling in `Invoke-External` wrapper (fixes Windows git clone stderr false-positive termination, from PR #13 + PR #15).

### Added
- **GEO agent deployed**: `agents/seo-geo.md` created -- `/seo audit` now spawns 7 parallel agents (was 6). GEO analysis covers AI crawler access, llms.txt, passage-level citability, brand mention signals, platform-specific scoring (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Bing Copilot).
- **`--googlebot` flag in `fetch_page.py`**: Detect prerender/dynamic rendering services by comparing response size with default UA vs Googlebot UA. First phase of SPA/CSR support (Issue #11).

### Fixed
- **URL normalization**: `capture_screenshot.py` and `analyze_visual.py` now accept bare domains (`example.com` -> `https://example.com`) via shared `normalize_url()` helper (from PR #16 by @shuofengzhang).
- **GEO weight**: AI Search Readiness weight increased from 5% to 10% in overall SEO Health Score. Technical SEO adjusted to 22%, Content Quality to 23%.
- **FAQPage guidance**: Blanket "remove FAQPage on commercial sites" updated to nuanced guidance -- existing FAQPage -> Info priority (not Critical), noting AI/LLM citation benefit. Adding new FAQPage -> not recommended for Google, note AI benefit. Updated in `seo/SKILL.md`, `agents/seo-schema.md`, `seo/references/schema-types.md`.
- **Uninstall agents list**: Added `seo-geo` to `uninstall.sh` and `uninstall.ps1` removal lists.
- **Python requirement**: Corrected from `3.8+` to `3.10+` in `README.md` and `docs/INSTALLATION.md`.

### Changed
- Subagent count: 6 -> 7 (added seo-geo to core audit pipeline)
- `.gitignore`: Added generated audit artifacts (charts/, PDFs, report.html, firebase-debug.log, generated-schema.json)

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **DataForSEO integration**: seo-audit, seo-content, seo-geo, seo-page, seo-plan, seo-technical auto-detect DataForSEO MCP tools for enriched analysis
- **Plugin manifest**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for official plugin directory submission
- **Documentation**: Extensions architecture in ARCHITECTURE.md, 22 new commands in COMMANDS.md, updated MCP integration guide

### Fixed

- **SSRF prevention**: Added to `capture_screenshot.py` (defense-in-depth, matching `fetch_page.py`)
- **Frontmatter cleanup**: Removed non-standard `allowed-tools` from main SKILL.md

### Changed
- Sub-skill count: 12 + 1 extension (added seo-dataforseo via DataForSEO extension)
- Subagent count: 6 + 1 optional (added seo-dataforseo agent via extension)
- DataForSEO promoted from "Community" to "Official extension" in MCP docs

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **User-Agent header**: Changed default from bot-style `ClaudeSEO/1.0` to Chrome-like string with `ClaudeSEO/1.2` suffix. SSR frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, Angular) now pre-render properly instead of serving empty client-side shells (#9)
- **Custom User-Agent support**: Added `--user-agent` flag to `fetch_page.py` for configurable UA strings

### Fixed
- **YAML frontmatter parsing**: Removed HTML comments before `---` delimiter in 8 files (skills: seo-content, seo-images, seo-programmatic, seo-schema, seo-technical; agents: seo-content, seo-performance, seo-technical). Thanks @kylewhirl for identifying this in the codex-seo fork.
- **Windows installer**: Merged @kfrancis improvements -- `python -m pip`, `py -3` launcher fallback, requirements.txt persistence, non-fatal subagent copy, better error diagnostics (PR #6)
- **requirements.txt missing after install**: Now copied to skill directory so users can retry (#1)

### Changed
- Python dependencies now installed in a venv at `~/.claude/skills/seo/.venv/` with `--user` fallback (#2)
- Playwright marked as explicitly optional in install output
- Windows installer uses `Resolve-Python` helper for robust Python detection (#5)
